Tool to make XFE API calls

Script explanation and purpose:

The IBM MSS team has the recurrent need of checking the IP reputation 
information during their investigations. This information may come from
different threat intelligence (TI) providers such as XForce Exchange (XFE).
Provided one or more IP addresses, this script leverages XFE's API to extract 
the information needed by the MSS team. As of this update, IPReplookup
uses only XFE's API but there plans to include more results from other
TI providers.

To run the script, simply execute it and help should display detailing 
the needed information.
